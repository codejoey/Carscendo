## Inspiration
Our parents forced 2 members of our team to learn a musical instrument as kids. We hated it. It simply wasn’t fun. It took us a long time to reach a level to compose music.
We wanted to make music composition more fun and accessible for beginners and people who wouldn’t normally associate music with themselves. More people are able to drive than play an instrument – we saw some potential there.

We drew inspiration from a [Taste Visualization scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xizttM_Cbuc) from The movie “Ratatouille”, and some of our member’s game development experience – to create a new medium of music composition. A racing game with stunning music visualisations.

## Mission Statement:

Carscendo’s mission is to provide a passive music compositional platform through the innovative medium of a multiplayer VR racing experience.

Through a combination of environmental and inter-vehicular interactions, the way a player races is reflected through changes in 3 core musical elements: emphasis, tone, and rhythm. By playing Carscendo, users who may consider themselves not musically inclined and discouraged from using conventional composition systems are able to passively develop an intuition for the core principles of music composition while enjoying a multiplayer racing experience. 

The racing game aspects not only provide a mechanically and visually simple way to manipulate music, but allow non-musicians to derive enjoyment from practice even if their musical skills are poor. By giving players this alternative outlet for enjoyment, they will be more likely to play for a long enough time to develop musical intuition without even realizing.


## Considerations

As players improve their skills in the game, they gain greater agency over the music their ‘drive’ produces, meaning that new and experienced players alike have something (think of more catchy verbage) to enjoy together.

It was important that Carsendo could serve as a fun experience for anyone to play and learn from- regardless of ability. With VR games as an emerging experience, we also think it crucial to set the standards for inclusivity higher than they have been for conventional games.

Many games assume a high level of physical and cognitive ability, thus players who may have impairments in either of those two areas either have to exert considerably more effort than a fully abled player, not be able to enjoy many facets of the experience, or not be able to play the game at all. 

In the design of Carscendo, we implemented the gameplay mechanics in as inclusive a way as possible. Some of these specific considerations include, visual elements paired with any audio feedback for hard of hearing or deaf players, controls that require low levels of digit dexterity for players with tremors or joint issues, and a UI system based on environment interactions rather than text for those who struggle reading, and so it can be easily understood regardless of language.
